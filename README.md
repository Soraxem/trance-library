# Trance Arduino library

This is the library for the Trance project. With this library you can easily create a realtime sACN device. with this you can build led Strips that are connected with a real lightshow. Or build a crazy contraption that is controllable entirely over Wifi.

Because the librarys that are needed are outdated, you have to use esp32 v3.0.4
